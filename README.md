### My Internships

- [**Open Vocabulary Few Shot Referral Image Segmentation | University Of Bath**](https://github.com/AADYA-ARORA/projectname): Techniques to partition images into semantic regions based on arbitrary text descriptions using MaskDINO, BERT, and CLIP.

- [**Advancing Autonomous Driving Systems for Indian Roads | IIIT Hyderabad **](https://github.com/AADYA-ARORA/projectname): Comprehensive solutions for uncommon scenarios and corner cases on Indian roads.

### My Projects

- [**Open Vocabulary Few Shot Referral Image Segmentation**](https://github.com/AADYA-ARORA/projectname): Techniques to partition images into semantic regions based on arbitrary text descriptions using MaskDINO, BERT, and CLIP.
- [**Shadow and Rainfall Removal in Images**](https://github.com/AADYA-ARORA/projectname): Techniques for improving accuracy of downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and object detection in adverse weather conditions using transformer and diffusion architectures.
- [**NextCharacterPredictor**](https://github.com/AADYA-ARORA/projectname): An MLP-based next character prediction model trained on several famous corpora.
- [**Advancing Autonomous Driving Systems for Indian Roads**](https://github.com/AADYA-ARORA/projectname): Comprehensive solutions for uncommon scenarios and corner cases on Indian roads.
- [**Human Activity Recognizion (HAR)**](https://github.com/ES335-2024/assignment-1-ml-tensionflow): Utilized the UCI-HAR dataset, which comprises time-series data capturing the activities of thirty subjects engaging in six different activities classified as walking, sitting, standing, running up, running straight and running down.
- [**FPGA Implementation of a Complete Processor Design**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17sn1dGt2OUcFvrcrlaF2K8Nw1NFW_ZPb/view): Designed a 8-bit, 16-register file processor, supporting arithmetic, logic and branch instructions using verilog. Synthesized and Implemented this design on a Basys3 board and tested it with complicated programs
- [**Fuzzy Logic based Android Application**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b3QZBsjZjNEj7Gf0RcK6uNscTXxKR9Eo): Designed and Deployed a fuzzy logic-based android app which detects fall of a device using accelerometer data. Implemented a fuzzy system, which uses fuzzy accelerometer and sound levels to detect danger levels. In case of high danger, triggers an alert to transmit sound and GPS data using TCP/IP to another phone
